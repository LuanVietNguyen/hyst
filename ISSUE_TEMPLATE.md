Please make sure you do the following before reporting bugs:

- [ ] Are you using the latest version of Hyst?
- [ ] Do you have a test that reproduces the problem? You can either have it in your branch or paste the junit test function
- [ ] Is your test minimal? Does it only contain the minimum amount in order to demonstrate the problem?
